# Introduction

Uplink delivers reusable and self-sufficient objects for accessing HTTP
webservices, with minimal code and user pain. Simply define your
consumers using decorators and function annotations, and weâ€™ll handle
the rest for you... pun intended, obviously ðŸ˜Ž

## Static Request Handling

Method decorators describe request properties that are relevant to all
invocations of a consumer method.

For instance, consider the following GitHub API consumer:

``` python
class GitHub(uplink.Consumer):
    @uplink.timeout(60)
    @uplink.get("/repositories")
    def get_repos(self):
        """Dump every public repository."""
```

Annotated with `timeout`, the method `get_repos` will build HTTP
requests that wait an allotted number of seconds -- 60, in this case
--for the server to respond before giving up.

As method annotations are simply decorators, you can stack one on top of
another for chaining:

``` python
class GitHub(uplink.Consumer):
    @uplink.headers({"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3.full+json"})
    @uplink.timeout(60)
    @uplink.get("/repositories")
    def get_repos(self):
        """Dump every public repository."""
```

## Dynamic Request Handling

For programming in general, function parameters drive a function's
dynamic behavior; a function's output depends normally on its inputs.
With `uplink`, function arguments parametrize an HTTP request, and you
indicate the dynamic parts of the request by appropriately annotating
those arguments.

To illustrate, for the method `get_user` in the following snippet, we
have flagged the argument `username` as a URI placeholder replacement
using the `uplink.Path` annotation:

``` python
class GitHub(uplink.Consumer):
    @uplink.get("users/{username}")
    def get_user(self, username: uplink.Path("username")): pass
```

Invoking this method on a consumer instance, like so:

``` python
github.get_user(username="prkumar")
```

Builds an HTTP request that has a URL ending with `users/prkumar`.

!!! note
As you probably took away from the above example: when parsing the
method's signature for argument annotations, `uplink` skips the instance
reference argument, which is the leading method parameter and usually
named `self`.
